Sure, here's a line-by-line explanation of the lexer:

```
%{
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
%}
```

These lines are called the "prologue" and "epilogue" of the lexer, respectively. They are used to include header files and define macros and global variables. In this case, we are including the `stdio.h` and `stdlib.h` header files, which provide functions for input/output and memory allocation, respectively.

```
%option noyywrap
```

This line sets the `noyywrap` option, which disables the default behavior of the lexer to wrap around to the beginning of the input when it reaches the end. Since we don't need this behavior in our lexer, we can disable it to simplify the code.

```
%%
```

This line separates the rules section from the prologue/epilogue. Everything before this line is part of the prologue, and everything after it is part of the rules section.

```
[a-zA-Z0-9]+([-_.][a-zA-Z0-9]+)*@[a-zA-Z0-9]+(\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+)+\.[a-z]{2,} {
    printf("Valid EMAIL: %s\n", yytext);
    exit(0); // terminate the program
}
```

This is the first rule of the lexer. It matches any string that follows the regular expression pattern for a valid email address, and prints a message indicating that the email is valid. It then terminates the program using the `exit()` function.

```
.|\n {
    static int valid_email_found = 0; // flag to track if a valid email has been found
    if (!valid_email_found) {
        printf("Not Accepted EMAIL\n");
        valid_email_found = 1; // set flag to true
    }
    if (*yytext == '\n') {
        valid_email_found = 0; // reset flag at the end of a line
    }
}
```

This is the second rule of the lexer. It matches any character that is not a newline character. This rule is used to catch any invalid email addresses that do not match the pattern in the first rule. 

The `valid_email_found` variable is a flag that is used to keep track of whether a valid email has been found yet. It is declared as `static` to ensure that its value persists between calls to the rule.

If `valid_email_found` is still 0 (indicating that no valid email has been found yet), the rule prints a message indicating that the email is not accepted, and sets the `valid_email_found` flag to 1 to indicate that an invalid email has been found.

If the current character is a newline character, the `valid_email_found` flag is reset to 0 to prepare for the next line.

```
%%

int main() {
    yylex();
    return 0;
}
```

These lines mark the end of the rules section and define the `main()` function, which is the entry point of the program. The `yylex()` function is called to start the lexer, and the program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
