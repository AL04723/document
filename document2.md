Sure, here's a line-by-line explanation of the lexer and its functions:

```
%{
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
%}
```

This section includes the header files `stdio.h` and `stdlib.h`, which contain function declarations for input/output operations and memory management, respectively. The `%{` and `%}` symbols are used to enclose any C code that should be included in the generated lexer. In this case, we include the header files.

```
%option noyywrap
```

This option tells Flex not to generate the `yywrap()` function, which is used to implement input buffering. Since we are not using input buffering in this program, we can safely turn this option on.

```
%%
```

The double percent symbols indicate the start of the rules section. This is where we define the regular expressions and actions for the lexer.

```
[a-zA-Z0-9]+([-_.][a-zA-Z0-9]+)*@[a-zA-Z0-9]+(\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+)+\.[a-z]{2,} {
    printf("Valid EMAIL: %s\n", yytext);
    exit(0); // terminate the program
}
```

This rule matches a valid email address using a regular expression. The regular expression matches one or more alphanumeric characters, followed by an optional group of characters containing a hyphen, underscore, or period, followed by one or more alphanumeric characters. This group can be repeated zero or more times. The "@" character is then matched, followed by one or more alphanumeric characters, optionally followed by one or more groups of characters containing a period and one or more alphanumeric characters. Finally, a period followed by two or more lowercase letters is matched to ensure the top-level domain is valid. When this rule matches, the email address is printed with the "Valid EMAIL" message, and the program is terminated using the `exit()` function.

```
.|\n {
    static int valid_email_found = 0; // flag to track if a valid email has been found
    if (!valid_email_found) {
        printf("Not Accepted EMAIL\n");
        valid_email_found = 1; // set flag to true
    }
    if (*yytext == '\n') {
        valid_email_found = 0; // reset flag at the end of a line
    }
}
```

This rule matches any character (except newline) or a newline character. If this rule is matched, it means that the current input is not a valid email address. A static integer variable `valid_email_found` is declared to track whether a valid email address has been found yet. If `valid_email_found` is false, the "Not Accepted EMAIL" message is printed. The `valid_email_found` variable is then set to true. If the matched character is a newline, the `valid_email_found` variable is reset to false to indicate the start of a new line.

```
%%

int main() {
    yylex();
    return 0;
}
```

The double percent symbols indicate the end of the rules section. This section contains the `main()` function, which calls the `yylex()` function to start the lexer. Once the lexer finishes processing the input, the program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
